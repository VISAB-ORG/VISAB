/**
 * This package contains all custom exceptions that may be necessary in VISAB.
 * <p>
 * JAVA itself provides a variety of exceptions that refer to compile and
 * runtime issues of the code itself. However to make an application more
 * verbose sometimes custom exceptions may be useful. For example if a wrong
 * game name is passed to VISAB for communication, it is possible to throw a
 * specific exception directly referring to this particular error.
