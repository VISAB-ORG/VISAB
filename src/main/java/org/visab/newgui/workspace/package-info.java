/**
 * This package contains all high level classes / interfaces that are used to
 * handle the actions within the VISAB workspace.
 * <p>
 * The VISAB workspace is a directory where VISAB stores all its files that are
 * either put there during the run time or exposed for other purposes.
 * 
 * Current idea:
 * <ul>
 * <li>database: Stores visab game data files for visualization.</li>
 * <li>configs: Stores any config file used by VISAB.</li>
 * <li>logs: Stores visab log files for traceability.</li>
 * <li>... further useful sub-directories may be added ...</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
