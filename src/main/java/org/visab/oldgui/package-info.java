/**
 * This package contains the controllers of the legacy VISAB GUI.
 * <p>
 * In the future this package will get merged / substituted with contents of the
 * "newgui" package because the legacy implementation does not really follow an
 * abstracted design pattern to distinct between models, views and controls.
