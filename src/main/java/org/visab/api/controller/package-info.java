/**
 * This package contains all the controllers that are responsible for handling
 * requests on the different API end points.
 * <p>
 * The VISAB API controls information flow by implementing a publish-subscribe
 * pattern with a central event bus that handles information distribution
 * accordingly when getting accessed by these controllers.
 * 
 * The actual implementation of the event bus can be found in the org.visab.eventbus package.
