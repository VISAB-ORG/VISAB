/**
 * This package contains the high level classes for the HTTP Server API of
 * VISAB.
 * <p>
 * The HTTP (web) API is the data transmission end point for any game that is
 * communicating with VISAB to send its game data to be visualized.
 * 
 * Despite games there may be other use cases in the future that implement some
 * communication with the VISAB API. E.g. exposing files from the database to
 * other services.
