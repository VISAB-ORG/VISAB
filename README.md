VISAB is a standalone util to visualize artificial intelligence agent actions in Unity Games. 

It aims at providing generic utilization and easy modifiability to integrate further games 
with minimal effort in the respective games.

There are two modes VISAB can be used: 

<ol>
  <li><b>GUI Mode</b>: This mode provides features for visualizing game data files which were generated by VISAB in headless mode.</li>
  <li><b>Headless Mode*</b>: This mode starts VISAB as server application that is capable of receiving data from Unity Games via TCP/IP</li>
</ol>
 
### Extending VISAB for a new game
1. Create SessionListener by inheriting either SessionListenerBase (or ReplaySessionListenerBase if you need a ReplayView)
2. Create the Statistics POJO (and a Image POJO if you need a Replay View)
3. Create a VISAB File by inheriting VISABFileBase
4. Create a StatisticsView + ViewModel (and additionally a ReplayView + ViewModel if needed) // TODO: This can be done by inheriting
5. Lastly add your created classes to the dynamicMapping.json file

Thats it. None of the existing code has to be touched - were just adding new stuff.
