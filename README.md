VISAB is a standalone util to visualize artificial intelligence agent actions in Unity Games. 

It aims at providing generic utilization and easy modifiability to integrate further games 
with minimal effort in the respective games.

There are two modes VISAB can be used: 

<ol>
  <li><b>GUI Mode</b>: This mode provides features for visualizing game data files which were generated by VISAB in headless mode.</li>
  <li><b>Headless Mode*</b>: This mode starts VISAB as server application that is capable of receiving data from Unity Games via TCP/IP</li>
</ol>

*This mode is not yet currently implemented, but it will be in the future.
